Assuming you have Python 2 or 3 installed on your machine, `sudo pip install virtualenv` to install a Virtual Environment for your dependencies. It is highly recommended to do this instead of polluting your computer's global namespace.
`virtualenv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate` to activate your Virtual Environment.
`pip install requirements.txt`
